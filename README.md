# InstaParser

## Description

This program will iterate through your (given) followers and following with requested .json files from Instagram. After the iteration is done, it will show you the list of users who you follow and do not follow you back. 

## Instructions

- Please put your .json files into the json directory. 
    - They should look something like `followers.json` and `following.json`. 

- Execute `parser.py` and give the correlating filenames that you wish to be parsed through (do not confused followers and following).
